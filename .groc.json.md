# Project configuration

If not explicitly excluded, every commandline-option as described in [Command 
Line Interface](cli.html) or and summarized via `groc -h`  can be given to ease
the (re-)generation of the project's documentation. Arguments must be specified
via a configuration file in the current directory named `.groc.json` (like this
file). It should contain a mapping between groc's option names and their values,
hence you must preserve the option's type.
