# A core concept of `groc` is that your code is grouped into a project, and that there is a certain
# amount of context that it lends to your documentation.
#
# A project:
module.exports = class Project
  constructor: (root, outPath, minLogLevel=Logger::INFO) ->
    @options = {}
    @log     = new Logger minLogLevel

    # * Has a single root directory that contains (most of) it.
    @root = path.resolve root
    # * Generally wants documented generated somewhere within its tree.  We default the output path
    #   to be relative to the project root, unless you pass an absolute path.
    @outPath = path.resolve @root, outPath
    # * Contains a set of files to generate documentation from, source code or otherwise.
    @files = []
    # * Should strip specific prefixes of a file's path when generating relative paths for
    #   documentation.  For example, this could be used to ensure that `lib/some/source.file` maps
    #   to `doc/some/source.file` and not `doc/lib/some/source.file`.
    @stripPrefixes = []

  # Annoyingly, we seem to be hitting a race condition within Node 0.10's
  # emulation for old-style streams.  For now, we're dropping concurrent doc
  # generation to play it safe.  People are still using groc with 0.6.
  oldNode = process.version.match /v0\.[0-8]\./
  # This is both a performance (over-)optimization and debugging aid.  Instead of spamming the
  # system with file I/O and overhead all at once, we only process a certain number of source files
  # concurrently.  This is similar to what [graceful-fs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs)
  # accomplishes.
  BATCH_SIZE: if oldNode then 10 else 1

  # Where the magic happens.
  #
  # Currently, the only supported option is:
  generate: (options, callback) ->
    @log.trace 'Project#Generate(%j, ...)', options
    @log.info 'Generating documentation...'

    # * style: The style prototype to use.  Defaults to `styles.Default`
    style = new (options.style || styles.Default) @

    # We need to ensure that the project root is a strip prefix so that we properly generate
    # relative paths for our files.  Since strip prefixes are relative, it must be the first prefix,
    # so that they can strip from the remainder.
